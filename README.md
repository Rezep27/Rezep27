## Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer student that is very passionate about everything realted to computers 💻. I love programming, learning new things 📖, solving problems 👨‍💻, and I like challenges 🧗.

I am currently working on some small personal projects like webscrappers, parsers, and playing with the ChatGPT API to automate cool stuff.

I am learning about web development, software architecture and programming patterns, multithreading and parallel programming.
